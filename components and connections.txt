🧩 Components Needed:
1 × Arduino Uno/Nano

1 × Rain sensor module (with analog or digital output)

1 × L298N motor driver module (or similar H-bridge)

2 × DC motors (to open and close the roof)

1 × LED (optional, for status)

Jumper wires

Power supply (Battery or adapter)

⚙️ Circuit Connections:
📦 Rain Sensor:
VCC → Arduino 5V

GND → Arduino GND

DO (digital out) → Arduino pin 7 (rain in your code)

⚡ L298N Motor Driver:
IN1 → Arduino pin 5 (in1)

IN2 → Arduino pin 6 (in2)

ENA → Connect to 5V or use PWM pin if you want speed control

Motor A terminals → Connect to your motor (or relay system to open/close roof)

GND → Arduino GND

VCC → External power supply (6V–12V for motors)

5V jumper (optional): Only if your L298N needs to power logic from motor power (check module specs)

💡 LED (optional):
Long leg (anode) → Arduino pin 13 (ledPin)

Short leg (cathode) → 220Ω resistor → Arduino GND
